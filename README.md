Linear Algebra Library

OVERVIEW
The Linear Algebra Library is a Python-based library that provides basic and advanced matrix operations. The library is designed for educational and practical purposes, making it easier to perform linear algebra computations programmatically. It includes core functionality like matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, inversion, transposition, and determinant calculation.

The project follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, with clear and maintainable code that can be easily extended for additional features such as matrix decompositions and eigenvalue computations.

FEATURES
Matrix operations: Addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and matrix multiplication.
Advanced operations: Transpose, determinant, and matrix inversion (using cofactor and adjugate methods).
Error handling: Checks for invalid matrices (non-rectangular data), dimension mismatches, and singular matrices (non-invertible).
Modular design: Easy to extend for more advanced linear algebra techniques such as LU decomposition, eigenvalue/eigenvector computations, etc.
Installation
To use the Linear Algebra Library, clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies.

PREREQUISITES
Python 3.x
No external dependencies (all functions are implemented natively)
